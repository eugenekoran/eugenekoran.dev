## Overview

This project explores methods for causally intervening in language model computations to deliberately steer their reasoning strategies. By identifying and manipulating specific activations, we can influence which search algorithms and problem-solving approaches a model employs.

## Key Contributions

- Developed causal intervention methods for steering model reasoning
- Applied linear probing to identify activation patterns corresponding to different reasoning strategies
- Demonstrated targeted activation steering on Distill-Qwen-1.5B
