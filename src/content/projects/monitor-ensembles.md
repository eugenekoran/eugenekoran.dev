## Overview

Research conducted as part of the Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR), investigating multi-monitor ensemble techniques that enhance the safety-usefulness Pareto frontier for AI Control systems by strategically aggregating diverse monitoring signals.

## Key Contributions

- Designed specialized prompting strategies and fine-tuned GPT-4.1-mini variants for backdoor detection
- Demonstrated that strategic diversity in monitor ensembles significantly outperforms single-monitor baselines
- Achieved 13+ percentage point improvement in partial AUC (pAUC) using a 3-monitor ensemble
- Preparing findings for ICLR 2026 submission

## Technologies

Python, Inspect AI, OpenAI API, PyTorch
